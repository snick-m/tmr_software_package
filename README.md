# TorontoMetRobotics 2023 Fall Recruitment 
### Software Package
Submission repository for the Software Package, Option A and Camera System.[^1]
For my solution, I've built a rough 3D representation of the Robotic Arm and
PWM Meters for each motor. Additionally all received commands are listed along with timestamps.

### How to Run
1. run `python websocket_server.py`
2. run `npm start`
3. run `python controller_client.py`
4. Now you can use `w,a,s,d` for driving and `r f t g y h v b n m o p` for Arm controls
5. Use `1 2 3 4 5` to test various invalid packets. Hover on highlighted packets for more error info.
